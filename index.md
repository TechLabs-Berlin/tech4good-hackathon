TechLabs is a non-profit organization for students from all disciplines that volunteers to teach digital literacy skills such as basic programming, data science, artificial intelligence and web development through online courses, an active local community and hands-on projects.

The concept was developed in 2017 in MÃ¼nster and has meanwhile proven itself at 6 locations worldwide.

In 2018, the idea also won the Google Impact Challenge.
